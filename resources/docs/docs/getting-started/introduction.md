Welcome to Open Stage Control documentation. Along these pages you'll learn how to setup OSC on your system and everything you need to start building your own control interface.

!!! info "Still using v0 ?"
    The documentation for this version is available [here](https://v0.openstagecontrol.ammd.net).

## Overview

Open Stage Control consists in 3 modules: the server, the launcher and the client.

The **server** is the core of the software, it is responsible for sending and receiving all osc/midi messages, and act as a web server that serves the clients web application. It is written in Javascript and runs with Electron, a cross-platform framework based on Chromium. By default, the server always opens a client window when it starts but it can be run in *headless* mode, without any window.

The **launcher** provides a simple way to configure and start the server. It appears whenever the server is not launched from a terminal or without being configured.

The **client** is the web application made available by the server when it starts. Any compatible browser that connects to the server by browsing to its address will create a new client instance and be able to open and modify sessions.


## Requirements

The **server** can run on all [platforms supported by Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/support#supported-platforms). Systems that can run [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) may also be able to run it in headless mode (see [Running with Node](./running-with-node.md)).

The **client** is compatible with the following browsers:

- Firefox: version `75`
- Chromium / Chrome: version `60`

iOS devices must be of version `10.3` or higher.
